### Question 1 - Exploring Data with Histograms [4 points]

Using the county dataset, choose one of the numeric variables to construct a histogram for. (Due to extreme values, I recommend avoiding population variables.)

```{r histogram}
# Include code here to construct a histogram from the county dataset
#  Be sure to change the labels of the axes to be a proper graphical display!


# hist(NA, xlab='xlabel', ylab='ylabel', main='title')

```

#### For your histogram, address the following below:
* What is the shape of the distribution of this variable?
* Can you explain any trends you see in the shape in the context of the data?

### Question 2 - Exploring Data with Boxplots (Comparing States) [4 points]

First, copy your code used to make clustered samples to the code chunk provided below. Do not edit the `set.seed(311)` command, to ensure your results are consistent each time knitr is compiled.

```{r myClustered}
set.seed(311)
# Include your code from HW1 to create the my.Clustered dataset
# Keep the added last line at the end.


# Do not touch the code below.
my.Clustered$state<-droplevels(my.Clustered$state)
```

Using your cluster sample, choose one of the numeric variables to construct a set of compariative boxplot comparing results between the five different states in your sample. (Due to extreme values, I recommend avoiding population variables.)

```{r boxplot1}
# Include code here to construct a compariative boxplot from the states in your 
#  my.Clustered dataset
#  Be sure to change the labels of the axes to be a proper graphical display!

# boxplot(NA~my.Clustered$state, xlab='xlabel', ylab='ylabel', main='title')

```

#### For your boxplots, address the following below:
* What trends do you notice when comparing the variable of interest for different states?

### Question 3 - Exploring Data with Boxplots (Comparing Education Level) [4 points]

Using the full county dataset, choose one of the numeric variables to construct a set of compariative boxplot comparing results between the four different education levels. (Due to extreme values, I recommend avoiding population variables, but an enterprising student may attempt a log-transformation of that variable here.)

```{r boxplot2}
# Include code here to construct a compariative boxplot from the education 
# levels in the county dataset
#  Be sure to change the labels of the axes to be a proper graphical display!

# boxplot(NA~county$median_edu, xlab='xlabel', ylab='ylabel', main='title')

```

#### For your boxplots, address the following below:
* What trends do you notice when comparing the variable of interest for different education levels?
* Can you explain the trends you are observing based on your knowledge of how levels of education might relate to your variable of interest?

### Question 4 - Exploring Data with Scatterplots [4 points]

Using the full county dataset, choose two of the numeric variables to construct a scaterplot to examine how the variables relate to each other. (Due to extreme values, I recommend avoiding population variables, but an enterprising student may attempt a log-transformation of that variable here. Regardless, I would not use population twice as it is not very interesting!)

```{r scatterplot}
# Include code here to construct a scatterplot from the county dataset
#  Be sure to change the labels of the axes to be a proper graphical display!

# plot(county$Y~county$X, xlab='xlabel', ylab='ylabel', main='title')
# or 
# plot(county$X, county$Y, xlab='xlabel', ylab='ylabel', main='title')

```

#### For your scatterplot, address the following below:
* What trends do you notice as it relates to the relationship between your two variables?
* Can you explain the trends you are observing based on your knowledge of how the two variables might relate to each other?
