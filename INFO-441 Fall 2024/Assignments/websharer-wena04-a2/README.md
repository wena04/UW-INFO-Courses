I extracted the site-name for the website and also the author

Website that has it: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0

Visual Styling or Layout Improvement of the html the server returns:

Added rounded corners instead of just the striaght box and also a shadow. Also added a few things in the CSS file to make it so that all the text is aligned left. some more things like that. I think this just makes it look more visually appealing
